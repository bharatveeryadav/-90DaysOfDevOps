# 100DaysOfDevOps
This repository is my documenting repository for learning DevOps. I started this journey on the 16th  October  2022 and I plan to run to December 16th for a complete 90-day romp on spending an hour a day including weekends to get a foundational knowledge across a lot of different areas that make up DevOps
